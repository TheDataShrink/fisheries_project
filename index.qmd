## Preface {.unnumbered}

📚 Welcome to the comprehensive guide for automating SPC's fisheries data management processes. This book outlines a modern approach to handling operational logbook fisheries data, moving from manual Excel processing to an automated, database-driven solution.

## Project Overview {.unnumbered}

🎯 Each year SPC receives **`operational logbook fisheries data`** from distant water **`fishing nations`**, in various **`Excel formats`**. Describe a simple system for **`automating data reception, loading, checking, and consolidating into an SQL Server database`** – as an alternative to **`emailing Excel files and manual formatting/loading`**. This presentation is aimed at **`data management staff`** as a proposal for a new way of doing things, to **`improve efficiency`**. Please provide enough detail to understand the **`proposed process and anticipated benefits`**, but not all of the technical details required for implementation.

### Key Objectives {.unnumbered}

- 🤖 [Automate data reception and processing](02-data-reception.qmd)
- 📋 [Standardize data formats](03-data-preparation.qmd)
- ✅ [Implement robust validation](03-data-preparation.qmd#data-validation)
- ⚡ [Improve operational efficiency](05-evaluation.qmd)
- 🎯 [Ensure data quality and consistency](03-data-preparation.qmd#quality-control)

📖 This book follows the CRISP-DM methodology while addressing specific needs of fisheries data management:

1. 🔍 Each chapter corresponds to a CRISP-DM phase:
   - [Chapter 1: Introduction and Business Understanding](01-introduction.qmd)
   - [Chapter 2: Data Reception and Understanding](02-data-reception.qmd)
   - [Chapter 3: Data Preparation and Processing](03-data-preparation.qmd)
   - [Chapter 4: System Architecture and Modeling](04-system-architecture.qmd)
   - [Chapter 5: System Evaluation and Benefits](05-evaluation.qmd)
   - [Chapter 6: Implementation and Deployment](06-implementation.qmd)

2. 💡 Practical examples and implementation details are provided in each chapter:
   - [Technical Documentation](appendix-a.qmd)
   - [User Guides](appendix-b.qmd)
   - [References and Glossary](appendix-c.qmd)

3. 🔧 Technical content is balanced with user-friendly explanations throughout all chapters

4. 📊 Interactive elements enhance understanding with:
   - Mermaid diagrams
   - R code examples
   - Interactive visualizations

5. 📈 Clear progression from concept to implementation:
   - Start with the [Introduction](01-introduction.qmd)
   - Follow the implementation guide in [Chapter 6](06-implementation.qmd)
   - Reference the [Technical Documentation](appendix-a.qmd) as needed
